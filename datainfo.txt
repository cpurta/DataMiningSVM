In order to run the script you will have to get the data from the kaggle competition website:
http://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl/data
Then you will have to unzip the data and put those folders into a competition_data folder for the script 
to work correctly or modify the script to read in from the current directory which has the train and test
data. This will be modified and the correct directory hierarchy added after 3/17/15 due to the size of the
data resting on another directory on my system. Will move and push to repo after the other directory is
finished working with.
